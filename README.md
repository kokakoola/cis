## Wiki
Look into [wiki](https://github.com/kokakoola/cis/wiki) to get a better overview.

## Existing examples 
Locals (Aktors hired) are building a [wordpress-page for court](http://sulicourt.com/home-2/) what shall be linked or otherwise integrated with our system.

Dubai has a proffesional [e-court system](http://www.dubaicourts.gov.ae/portal/page?_pageid=292,433242&_dad=portal&_schema=PORTAL) -  we can learn some of that page as it is a role model for client.

## Workflow
As an international project with participans from different locations/companies (I can count 3 in Estonia and 2 in Kurdistan) it needs speciflicly good toolset for collaboration. TFS is good for some things, I would add [Asana](https://asana.com/) for tracking and [Slack](https://slack.com/) for communicationg and Usersnap[https://usersnap.com/] for onscreen commenting. For all listed tools the testaccounts are created (named Kurdi Kohus), depends on project manager wether they will be used or not.

Hanno has written about their tools for [collaboration](http://hanno.co/logbook/nine-tools-to-keep-our-remote-team-together), peek-in into their general workflow is [here](http://playbook.hanno.co/).
Read about [Slack and Asana](http://qcmny.com/tools-and-technology/3-collaboration-tools-cant-live-without/)

## Fonts and directions
We go with the bulletproofed [Google fonts](http://www.google.com/design/spec/style/typography.html#): Roboto (light, Normal, Medium e.g. 300, 400, 500) for english version, Noto for arabic and kurdish. Thats for the webpage. All the documents influenced by MS Word and possibly sent by email shall use unicode fonts.

Other suggestionst for [arabic webfonts](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7185106/what-are-my-web-font-choices-for-arabic) by community, in Google fonts are arabic-persian fonts under [early access fonts](http://www.google.com/fonts/earlyaccess). Note that arabic and kurdish letters are not the same.

Pay attention that rtl-writing starts from end - in our understanding. They take the file and start to fill it from end. 

As we are going with scss version, there is a helper for [rtl-support](http://www.matanich.com/2013/09/06/rtl-css-with-sass/)

## Colors
The color pallette should be nordic and unobtrusive - was the clients wish. The sample pallettes are in [Coolor account](http://coolors.co/092327-0b5351-00a9a5-b5c2b7-8c93a8).

## List of used plugins and methods

- upload images with [dropzone](http://www.dropzonejs.com/), documentation for .NET [here](http://venkatbaggu.com/file-upload-in-asp-net-mvc-using-dropzone-js-and-html5/)
- frontpage and first user manual page scroll based on [pagePiling.js](https://github.com/alvarotrigo/pagePiling.js#pagepilingjs)
- bubbles for guide tips - [crumble](http://blog.tommoor.com/crumble/)
- general animation of elements on pagescroll - [wow.js](http://mynameismatthieu.com/WOW/). A decent [example](https://www.box.com/notes/) about it is Boxnotes.
- [HTML5 fullscreen API](http://davidwalsh.name/fullscreen) Explained in detail [here](http://www.hongkiat.com/blog/html5-fullscreen-api/)

## Maybe-plugins
- svg interaction to replace flash [snap.svg](http://snapsvg.io/)
- resource of [guide plugins](http://ninodezign.com/25-free-jquery-plugins-for-doing-guided-tours-through-a-website/)

## Framework and UI examples to use as base 
- [Questionary](https://ethn.io/22910)
- inputs will look like [this](http://codepen.io/sevilayha/full/IdGKH/)
-  the style is used in [Paper Elements](http://www.polymer-project.org/components/paper-elements/demo.html#paper-shadow)
- Polymer tutorial by [Sitepoint](http://www.sitepoint.com/introduction-to-web-components-and-polymer-tutorial/)
-  sample admin themes to get started: [Bootbundle app](http://bootbundle.herokuapp.com/resources), [bootstraptor](http://demo.bootstraptor.com/bs_deal.html) (less-based) and [Detail Admin](http://wrapbootstrap.com/preview/WB07061TJ). And cool angular-template [Flafull](http://flatfull.com/themes/angulr/#/app/docs) - pay attention to ui-jq what allows you to call the jQuery function or plugin specified on the element.


## Usability testing
[This](http://ui-patterns.com/blog/complete-review-ux-usability-tools-website#ab_testing) article giver probably a pretty good overview of available tools. Session recording app for windows would be [Usability Studio](http://www.sketchman-studio.com/usability-studio/) - as local computers have built-in camera, the implementation would be easy.
